They possess the empathy to understand each student's unique perspective, the patience to let a discussion unfold, and the wisdom to ensure every voice is heard. They don't just teach a subject; they cultivate a safe, collaborative space where our philosophy becomes a shared experience."

In a micro-class, students learn to build on each other's ideas, challenge assumptions respectfully, and articulate their own viewpoints with clarity. It's a dynamic environment that mirrors the collaborative settings of top universities and modern workplaces, building essential skills for life."
